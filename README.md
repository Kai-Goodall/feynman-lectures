# The Feynman Challenge

Self-Studying The Feynman Lectures on Physics.

The objective is to go through each chapter starting with: Volume 1: Mainly Mechanics, Radiation, and Heat. Then Volume 2: Mainly Electromagnetism and Matter. Finally, Volume 3: Quantum Mechanics.

After each chapter, I aim to complete the respective exercises within the Exercises for the Feynman Lectures on Physics to apply my knowledge to problems critically. 

Discussions will be held with fellow autodidacts within our discord server :D https://discord.gg/YjY9JC2j9j (You get roles for each of the chapters you complete :^)
