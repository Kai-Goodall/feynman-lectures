# The Feynman Challenge

Self-Studying The Feynman Lectures on Physics.

The objective is to go through each chapter starting with: Volume 1: Mainly Mechanics, Radiation, and Heat. Then Volume 2: Mainly Electromagnetism and Matter. Finally, Volume 3: Quantum Mechanics.

After each chapter, I aim to complete the respective exercises within the Exercises for the Feynman Lectures on Physics to apply my knowledge to problems critically.
